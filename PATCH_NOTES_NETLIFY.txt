This is a Netlifyâ€‘ready replacement preserving your Mocha app's UI and styling.

Changes applied:
- public/_redirects added for SPA routing.
- vite.config.* ensured to import @vitejs/plugin-react and export a minimal config.
- package.json scripts normalized (build = vite build), added @vitejs/plugin-react, pinned Node.
- tsconfig.json excludes src/worker/** and includes vite/client types.
- netlify.toml added as a backup redirect config.

No pages/components/styles were removed.
