Netlify patch applied to your Mocha app. UI/components/styles are preserved.
Changes:
- Added public/_redirects and netlify.toml for SPA routing
- Vite config uses @vitejs/plugin-react; ensures build.outDir = "dist"
- package.json scripts normalized; added @vitejs/plugin-react
- tsconfig excludes src/worker/** and includes vite/client types
